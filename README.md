# NightLight
This project is a Motion-Detecting Light that lights up in the dark when motion is detected.
Components:
    -An Arduino. You could use any Arduino for this project. However, I would be using the Arduino Uno for the sake of simplicity. Cost: $ 3 to $ 50 (USD) depending on which              version you buy.
    -An LDR (Light Detecting Resistor) or a Photoresistor. Cost: 15 to 20 Cents (USD).
    -A PIR or Passive Infrared Sensor. Cost: $ 5 to $ 9 (USD)
    -A 100k Î© Resistor.(Brown-Black-Yellow-Gold)
    -A couple of Male-to-Male and Male-to-Female wires

Complexity: Absolute Beginners
